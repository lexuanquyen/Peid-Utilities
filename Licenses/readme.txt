This folder contains licenses for the JUG tool at 3rdParty/src/jug and the w3c codec classes at /src/org/w3c.
The JUG classes are included from their distribution jar and the codec classes are compiled from a branch of
the source tree. Both of these components are distributed here in source, are unmodified from their original
distribution, and are distributed with their original licences.
