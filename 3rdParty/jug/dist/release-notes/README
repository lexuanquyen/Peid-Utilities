== "JUG" - Java Uuid Generator ==

JUG is a set of Java classes for generating UUIDs. It generates
UUIDs according to the UUID specification (IETF draft), found 
(for example) at:

http://www1.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/uuid-guid/draft-leach-uuids-guids-01.txt
[draft id being '<draft-leach-uuids-guids-01.txt>']

Alternatively you can also read newer IETF draft that described URN
name space for UUIDs, as it contains UUID definition:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mealling-uuid-urn-00.txt

JUG can be used as a command-line tool (via class org.doomdark.uuid.Jug),
or as a pluggable component; see file USAGE for details.

JUG was created by Tatu Saloranta (<tatu.saloranta@iki.fi>).
Code portions related to native access of Ethernet interfaces
(code under jug-native and com/ccg) were written by
Paul Blankenbaker (Windows, Linux, Solaris) and DJ Hagberg (Mac OS X).
In addition, many other individuals have helped fix bugs and implement
new feeatures: please see CREDITS for the complete list.
