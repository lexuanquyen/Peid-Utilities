== Open Issues ==

As of version 2.0 here is the list of known problems.
Help in solving problems would be greatly appreciated, especially
on platforms I don't have access to (Windows 2000, Mac OS X).

#1. When reloading code through different class loaders (something
  application servers and servlet containers do), you may get
  "library already loaded error". If you encounter this problem,
  you can try to catch the exception.
  Main problem in trying to fix this problem is that since all classes
  are potentially reloaded, information about loaded status of
  native libs would have to be stored externally (to a file), and
  that could have other problems (lock files left behind etc.).

== Fixed Issues from Previous Versions ==

#1. Trying to access all interfaces (via getAllInterfaces()) does
    not work on Win2K platform (SP 3); it gets into infinite loop.
    [first reported by Florian Scharinger].
   Fixed in v1.1
#2. Mac OS X JNI code shoulf now properly implement getAllInterfaces().
   (same is true for FreeBSD since it's built from same source).
   Fixed in v2.0
